# External requirements
COC.nvim requires nodejs. I recommend installing nvm for managing node installations. 

# Specific settings for specific machines
Create a local_settings.vim (or similarly named symlink) to use a different colorscheme or settings on a specific machine. This filename is recognized in the .gitignore.
